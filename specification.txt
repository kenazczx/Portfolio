10 HTML Tags I used are <a>, <section>, <nav>, <ul>, <li>, <p>, <input>, <h3>, <header>, <button>
5 of the CSS properties used are font-size, padding-top, color, background-color, height
From Bootstrap, I used their navbar, contact form, and some buttons. From Javascript, I integrated when my contact form button is clicked, it will show that form has been submitted.
